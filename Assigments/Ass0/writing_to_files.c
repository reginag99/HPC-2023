//How does your choice of memory allocation (contiguous vs. 
//noncontiguous) impact the possibilties to write the matrix in text 
//and binary format? 

/*
If cont. its easier to both store and then print out the elements 
in the matrix, as you can handle it as an array. This is also how 
 things are stored in the memory, even if we see it as a matrix. 
 When using cont. its preferd to have binary format as it is easy 
 to get extraxt each element. If its text/string it can be more 
 important to store the content as it is read, so there is no 
 missunderstandings.
